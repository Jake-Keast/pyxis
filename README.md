# pyxis
Pyxis is a CPU Render Engine that utilises Monte Carlo Ray Tracing, written in Zig. This was a just for fun project I took on in order to build an understanding of the Zig language and to learn about ray tracing.
The program is invoked by "zig run src/main.zig | bzip2 > <filename>.ppm.bz2". Its clunky, but the ppm file format was the easiest to work with.
